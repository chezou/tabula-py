**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
On the PDF files that I have, the data is not always in a super clear format. There are times in which the text on the PDF is "wrapped" onto a second line. Therefore, when the file is exported to CSV, the data is inconsistent

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Within the function Tabula.Convert_into... there should be a function called "rows" where then user could configure that, for specific columns, you would specify the start point, end point, and number of rows
Tabula would then convert the CSV into two rows for every instance where the text shows "Line Item" and "Item No" and ignore everything else. 
In addition, the number of rows would force the conversion to wrap text in a certain number of rows. 

The user would type something like this:
columns = (1,2,3,4,5)
start = ('Line Item%', '', '', '', '')
end = ('Item No%', '%%', '', '', '')
rows = 3 (or 1, depending on if you want the start row and end row included in the count)

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Another option would be to just say "wrap text" Yes/No where, if the text in a column is at the edge, the next row of data would get wrapped 
Another option would be to specify the dimensions of a "typical" row size and the "maximum" row size, with the option to wrap text in a given way
